# Hostel Management System

This project is a Hostel Management System implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system allows you to manage hostelites (students), employees, and expenditures related to the hostel. It provides a menu-driven interface for various management operations.

## Features

1. **Login**: The system provides a login mechanism with a default username and password ("admin").

2. **Main Menu**: After logging in, the main menu is displayed with the following options:
   - Hostelites Management: Manage student-related operations.
   - Employees Management: Manage employee-related operations.
   - Expenditure: Manage hostel expenditure operations.
   - Back to Login: Return to the login screen.
   - Exit: Exit the system.

3. **Hostelites Management**:
   - Add a new student.
   - Remove a student.
   - Update student details.
   - Search for a student.
   - Display all students.
   - Return to the main menu.

4. **Employees Management**:
   - Add a new employee.
   - Remove an employee.
   - Update employee details.
   - Display all employees.
   - Return to the main menu.

5. **Expenditure Management**:
   - Add an expense.
   - Display all expenses.
   - Return to the main menu.

## How to Use

1. **Login**: Upon running the program, you'll be prompted to enter the username and password. The default credentials are "admin" for both.

2. **Main Menu**: After successful login, you'll be presented with the main menu options. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.

3. **Submenus**: Depending on the option you choose, you'll be presented with submenus for hostelites, employees, or expenditure management. Follow the prompts and enter the appropriate choices.

4. **Navigation**: You can navigate back to previous menus using the "Back" option.

5. **Exit**: To exit the system, select the "Exit" option from the main menu.
